# Problem

Sellers at small and mid-sized teams lose significant time on repetitive execution work instead of customer conversations.

## Core friction

- Manual note capture and CRM updates
- Follow-up delays and inconsistency
- Weak visibility into true decision-makers
- Poor meeting preparation and fragmented context
- Pipeline risk discovered too late

## Product thesis

Build a conversation-first AI Sales Execution System where every interaction feeds a closed loop:

1. Capture
2. Understand
3. Decide
4. Act
5. Learn

Every v1 feature must reduce rep admin time while improving next-step quality.

## Strategic posture

This platform is designed as a super app for sales teams. We reimagine workflows from first principles instead of layering AI on top of legacy CRM habits.
