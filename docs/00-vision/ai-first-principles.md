# AI First-Principles Manifesto

## Mission

Redefine sales execution by designing from first principles instead of automating legacy CRM habits.

## Core product principles

1. Conversation over administration.
2. Decisions over dashboards.
3. Execution loops over static records.
4. Human judgment over blind autonomy.
5. Compounding intelligence over one-off prompts.

## Reimagination rules

- If a workflow exists only because old tools require it, redesign it from zero.
- If humans do repetitive synthesis, replace with AI-generated options plus explicit approval.
- If context is fragmented across tools, unify into one action-ready narrative.
- If a metric cannot drive action in the next hour, it is secondary.

## AI-native interaction model

- AI proposes, humans choose.
- AI observes outcomes and adapts future suggestions.
- Every recommendation is traceable to source events and assumptions.
- Every outbound customer action passes governance gates.

## Product posture

- Build internal systems where intelligence quality is strategic.
- Integrate external systems where plumbing is commodity.
- Treat every shipped feature as a hypothesis against measurable seller outcomes.
