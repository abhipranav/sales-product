# ADR-0002: v1 Product Scope

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-07

## Context

The problem space is broad and can fragment execution if initial scope is too wide.

## Decision

v1 ships only the highest leverage capabilities:

- Rep cockpit with prioritized next actions
- Meeting preparation brief generation
- Follow-up draft and approval-first send assist
- Canonical data model and API contracts for core entities

## Rationale

- Directly attacks the highest-frequency seller pain with lowest implementation complexity
- Produces compounding data assets needed for advanced intelligence in later phases
- Avoids premature investment in autonomous outbound and dynamic pricing systems
